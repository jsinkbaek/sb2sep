# Quickstart
The package is separated into multiple modules. The functions associated with the spectral separation is located in the module

```
spectral_separation_routine
```

Here, the main two functions that can be used for spectral separation are called `spectral_separation_routine` and `spectral_separation_routine_multiple_intervals`. The last function is a wrapper on the first, that can also split the input spectra into multiple different intervals.
