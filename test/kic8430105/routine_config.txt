# # Config file for parent spectral separation routine # #
# Comment lines beginning with the #-symbol will be treated as empty.
# Each non-empty line must include a parameter name followed by its value.
# Trailing comments are allowed after this.

convergence_limit 1E-5		# Convergence criteria for RMS of radial velocities needed to exit 
				# routine.

iteration_limit 2		# Maximum allowed iterations of parent routine before automatic exit.

plot True			# If True, diagnostic plots are shown and updated between iterations.

verbose True			# Indicates if parent routine should print extra updates to console.

save_plot_path None		# If string and not None, final diagnostic plots are saved as a multi-
				# page PDF file in the specified folder.

save_all_results True		# If True, raw output data is saved to disk before returning from the
				# function. 

save_path results/		# Defines the folder that raw data is saved to when save_all_results
				# is True.

return_unbuffered True		# If True, any padding of spectra introduced and handled with the
				# buffer_mask parameter will be removed before returning results from
				# the routine. If no buffer_mask is supplied, this option does
				# nothing.
