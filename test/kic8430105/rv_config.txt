vsini_guess_B 1.0
delta_v_bf 1.0       # Should be None, or the same as routine_config delta_v. The only reason you would specify
                     # anything else is if you would want to calculate the broadening function using an internally
                     # different delta_v.
vary_vsini_A True	# Indicates if vsini should be fitted for. Usually best to set ensure correct shape of broadening function fit.
vary_vsini_B True
vsini_vary_limit_A None	# Limit on how must vsini can be changed during iteration. None = unconstrained. Float between
                        # 0 and 1, f.ex. 0.5 means vsini fit allowed to vary by 50 % from guess.
vsini_vary_limit_B None # If adjust_vsini is True in routine_config.txt, the initial guess will change after each

spectral_resolution 67000   # should be set to the spectral resolution of the spectrograph.
smooth_sigma_A 1.0	# Gaussian smoothing parameters in km/s to use on broadening functions before
smooth_sigma_B 3.5	# fitting. Inspect non-smoothed broadening functions first, 4.0 are likely
			        # too high. With a dim component B, a higher smoothing value than for A will
			        # make it possible to smooth out some of the noise from A.

bf_velocity_span 200	# Full-width of the broadening function in velocity space (km/s). If good first guesses are
                        # provided and system velocity is removed beforehand, this only needs to be slightly higher
                        # than 2*(K_A + K_B). Affects performance of routine significantly.
                        # You can also use the "center_on_system_rv" arguments below to specify an internal offset

ignore_at_phase_A None	# (float,float). If supplied, separated component A spectrum will not
			# be subtracted from spectra for RV_B calculation if they are within specific
			# phase interval. Interval can wrap around e.g. (0.98, 0.02). Make sure that
			# the time_values and period parameters are supplied to the routine, and that
			# np.mod(time_values, period)/period correspond to the phase given.
			# Do not use whitespace between the values in the parentheses.

verbose True		# If True, extra prints are done during this subroutine.

convergence_limit 1E-3	# Convergence criterium for RV in absolute units (km/s). If 1E-1, routine will

			# function plots of this limit.

center_on_system_rv_A False    # Used to shift the template to center on this before the broadening function
center_on_system_rv_B False    # measurement. This is beneficial if you want to save on processing power, as the
                                # method is most precise when you capture the signal of both comp.

evaluate_spectra_B [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,11,12,13,16,17,19,21]  # to evaluate convergence. F.ex., if evaluate_spectra_A = [0, 1], and evaluate_spectra_B = [1],
                         # rv subroutine will consider spectrum 0 converged if RV_A changed by less than
                         # convergence_limit (regardless of RV_B). And spectrum 1 will require both RV_A and RV_B to be
                         # below convergence_limit. Any other spectra will only do 1 iteration.
                         # This setting also indicates which RVs the parent routine should evaluate RMS for.
fitting_profile Gaussian    # Specifies the fitting profile used to fit the broadening function. Can either be 'RotBF' for
                         # 'rotational broadening function profile' or 'Gaussian' for a Gaussian profile. If 'Gaussian',
                         # vsini related parameters relate to the Gaussian sigma value (before broadening function
                         # smoothing and convolution to account for resolution). Limb darkening parameters are ignored
                         # when using 'Gaussian'.
