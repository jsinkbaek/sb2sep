vsini_guess_A 4.0       # initial guess for rotational broadening function fit. Generally okay to leave as is.
vsini_guess_B 4.0
vary_vsini_A True	# Indicates if vsini should be fitted for. Usually best to set ensure correct shape of broadening function fit.
vary_vsini_B True
vsini_vary_limit_A None	# Limit on how must vsini can be changed during iteration. None = unconstrained. Float between
                        # 0 and 1, f.ex. 0.5 means vsini fit allowed to vary by 50 % from guess.
vsini_vary_limit_B None # If adjust_vsini is True in routine_config.txt, the initial guess will change after each
                        # routine iteration.

spectral_resolution 67000   # should be set to the spectral resolution of the spectrograph.
smooth_sigma_A 2.0	# Gaussian smoothing parameters in km/s to use on broadening functions before
smooth_sigma_B 4.0	# fitting. Inspect non-smoothed broadening functions first, 4.0 are likely
			        # too high. With a dim component B, a higher smoothing value than for A will
			        # make it possible to smooth out some of the noise from A.

bf_velocity_span 150	# Full-width of the broadening function in velocity space (km/s). If good first guesses are
                        # provided and system velocity is removed beforehand, this only needs to be slightly higher
                        # than 2*(K_A + K_B). Affects performance of routine significantly.

velocity_fit_width_A 60 # How far away to include data during fitting of component A RV (km/s). (Half-width)
velocity_fit_width_B 20

refit_width_A None	# Float, if set, RV procedure is repeated with this velocity_fit_width_A after.
refit_width_B None	# These slows computation, but might improve final precision on found RVs.

limbd_coef_A 0.68	# Linear limb darkening coefficients. Are probably fine to leave when only RV is of interest.
limbd_coef_B 0.68
vary_limbd_coef_A False	# If True, rotational broadening function fitting will fit for limb darkening.
vary_limbd_coef_B False

ignore_at_phase_A None	# (float,float). If supplied, separated component A spectrum will not
			# be subtracted from spectra for RV_B calculation if they are within specific
			# phase interval. Interval can wrap around e.g. (0.98, 0.02). Make sure that
			# the time_values and period parameters are supplied to the routine, and that
			# np.mod(time_values, period)/period correspond to the phase given.
			# Do not use whitespace between the values in the parentheses.
			# If None, separated A spectrum is always used when calculating RV_B
ignore_at_phase_B (0.98,0.02)	# Same as above, but for component B.

verbose True		# If True, extra prints are done during this subroutine.

convergence_limit 5E-3	# Convergence criterium for RV in absolute units (km/s). If 1E-1, routine will
			            # consider an RV deviation of less than 0.1 km/s as succesfully converged.
iteration_limit 6	# Maximum allowed iterations per spectrum before breaking RV calculation loop.

rv_lower_limit 0.0	# Only relevant to change from 0.0 if you want plotted lines in the broadening
			# function plots of this limit.

evaluate_spectra_A None  # if not None and a list (no whitespace), only the given list of spectra (indices) will be used
evaluate_spectra_B None  # to evaluate convergence. F.ex., if evaluate_spectra_A = [0, 1], and evaluate_spectra_B = [1],
                         # rv subroutine will consider spectrum 0 converged if RV_A changed by less than
                         # convergence_limit (regardless of RV_B). And spectrum 1 will require both RV_A and RV_B to be
                         # below convergence_limit. Any other spectra will only do 1 iteration.
                         # This setting also indicates which RVs the parent routine should evaluate RMS for.
